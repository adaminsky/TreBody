# TreBody: 3 Body Simulator

![Demo](demo.gif)

Watch a 3 body simulation in 2 dimensions in your terminal.

- Currently not optimized in any way and does not even randomize initial
  conditions, so the simulation will probably be very similar every run as long
  as there are not large errors from the floating point arithmetic.
